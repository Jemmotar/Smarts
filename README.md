> Evaluation simulator for Smarts Network Filters solution

> This tool was inspirated by network monitoring solution Dell EMC Smarts. This network monitoring tool is gathering events from switches, routers and others netwrok devices via SNMP / syslogs / traps and based on that it is creating tickets for network team. Some of these events such a switch down, port down, service restarted and much more can be filtered by logging level on device. But also Dell EMCC Smarts has the feature to filter some events, the notification list. Unfornunately the notification list is just some list of rules. And since we have thousands of devices, around 20 customers and everyone wants to filter something, the notifaction list is full and confusing. Even small change can affect other rules, which can cause big outage in monitoring. For that reason this tool was created by Filipsi. And there is folder "filters" in .json format where are defined some of the conditions for the filter. Filter is mean the set of rules and the logical part is to use one filter per customer / type of device or some other big group. You can also find a folder "traps" which contains files with the traps. There are the values (most of them by Cisco SNMP definitions) are already transladed from numbers to their meaning.
